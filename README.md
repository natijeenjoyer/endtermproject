# Car Dealership Management System

## Project Overview

This Car Dealership Management System is a software solution designed to streamline the management and organization of a car dealership. Built using Java, the project demonstrates the application of various design patterns to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase. With the flexibility to manage car orders, reservations, and sales, this system showcases several key programming concepts and design principles in an automotive context.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Car Ordering**: Customers can order cars with optional features, such as a sunroof or a sports package.
- **Car Reservation and Sales Management**: Track and update the status of each car (available, reserved, sold).
- **Automated Client Notifications**: Clients receive automatic updates on new arrivals.
- **Modular Design**: The system utilizes multiple design patterns, ensuring extensibility and a clear separation of concerns.

## Design Patterns Implemented

1. **Software Architecture Pattern: MVC**
   - The system follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, organizing the code into logical components and improving maintainability.
   - **Model**: Represents data objects such as `Car` and `Database`.
   - **View**: Simulates the display layer, allowing users to view cars and updates.
   - **Controller**: Manages the flow of data between the Model and View.

2. **Creational Patterns**
   - **Singleton**: Ensures a single instance of the `Database` class to manage car inventory data consistently.
   - **Factory Method**: Simplifies the creation of cars of different types, encapsulating the instantiation logic.

3. **Structural Patterns**
   - **Decorator**: Adds dynamic features to cars, such as a sunroof or sports package, without modifying the base class.
   - **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface for ordering, reserving, and selling cars, hiding the complexity of underlying systems.

4. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - **Observer**: Manages automatic notifications to clients, informing them about new car arrivals.
   - **State**: Controls and updates the status of each car as "Available," "Reserved," or "Sold," affecting its interactions in the system.

## Class Diagram

The class diagram showcases the structure of the application, illustrating the relationships and interactions among the classes. It includes:
- **Car** classes with `Decorator` extensions for adding features.
- The **Facade** pattern managing high-level operations.
- **Observer** and **State** patterns governing notifications and status changes.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Main Application**: Execute the main class to start the dealership system. The initial configuration loads cars and initializes the inventory.
2. **Place an Order**: Use the `orderCar` function in the `CarDealershipFacade` to place a car order with optional features.
3. **Reserve or Sell Cars**: Change car states with the `reserveCar` and `sellCar` methods, demonstrating the `State` pattern.
4. **Receive Notifications**: Register a client to receive notifications about new cars.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- **Static Database**: The current version uses a simple in-memory database via the `Singleton` pattern. Future versions could integrate a persistent database.
- **Console-based Interface**: This version operates via console output; future iterations might include a graphical or web-based user interface.

## Development and Collaboration

- **Version Control**: This project is managed with Git, with each team member contributing meaningful, well-documented commits.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanations accompany each class and method in the codebase. UML diagrams illustrate system architecture and design pattern interactions.

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the system include:
- A persistent database with CRUD operations.
- A web or GUI-based user interface.
- Additional car features using new decorators.
- A broader range of car states to manage the lifecycle of each vehicle more precisely.

This Car Dealership Management System provides a robust foundation for managing automotive inventory, with an architecture that supports growth and scalability. By applying various design patterns, this project demonstrates efficient, maintainable coding practices essential for real-world software solutions.
